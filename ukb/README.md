# Introduction

Here is the code presented that was used to perform the analysis in UKB.

To analyse UKB data we used helper functions to extract the raw data, found [here](functions/functions.R). Scripts should be run in numerical order (00 -\> 09).

## Autoimmune disorders

We defined autoimmune disorders based on the criteria applied in [Glansville et al, 2020](https://www.bpsgos.org/article/S2667-1743(21)00004-5/fulltext). Briefly, we define criteria based on electronical medical records (ICD codes), self-reported conditions from interviews, and self-reported medication use. To qualify as a case, any individual have to meet at least 2 of out 3 of the above mentioned criteria.

## Major Depression and GAD
